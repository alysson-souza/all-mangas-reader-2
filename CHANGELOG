### V2.3.20
  New Mirrors:
    * Manga Cultivator (https://mangacultivator.com/)
    * GD Scans (https://gdegenscans.xyz/)
    * Unemployed Scans (https://unemployedscans.com/)

  Mirror Fixes:
    * Batoto - Added multiple domains
    * Leviatan Scans - Added sort by chapter number due to weird volume ordering
    * Manganelo - Added old domains for a few series that were not switched yet
    * Manga Pill - Chapter list changed
    * Reaper Scans - Switched site software, all old series will need readded


  Mangadex is back!
    This version introduces a "new" mirror labeled Mangadex V5, this was needed due to breaking changes in how the old mangadex series and title urls worked.
    
    When you launch your browser or reload the extension AMR will automatically try and convert any existing mangadex series you have followed to the new format,
    so you will not need to do this manually. This can sometimes cause an out of memory error which will force you to reload the extension or your browser window
    to continue, but I have not been able to reproduce it to find out why and test, since this is a one time thing I am not going to put any more time into trying.

    * Mint Manga has returned and has been updated (https://mintmanga.live) (Credit @NoneDark)

  Manganelo Change:
    Manganelo has rebranded itself as Manganato, this comes with a new url and unfortunately a new series url format. This means
    that any series you were following was reset and cannot be migrated automatically. You will need to re-add all series manually.
    You can do this by clicking the series link which *should* redirect you to the new one so you do not have to actually search
    for it. Sorry for this inconvienience but unfortunately there is little that can be done in this situation.
    New url: https://manganato.com/

### V2.3.16
  Changes:
    * Made import/export link not close current tab in Firefox

  Fixes:
    * Fixed style for import/export page

  New Mirrors:
    * Batoto (https://bato.to) * See note
    * Comic Kiba (https://comickiba.com/)
    * Lily Manga (https://lilymanga.com/)

  Mangafox/Fanfox Change:
    Changed the chapter list sorting to actually read the chapter title to get a sort based on the chapter number that is in the name.
    
    This worked for martial peak previously due to chapters going into the volume section after breaking the 999 chapter limit on the normal list, this
    was done now because there are several series that are being split into including volume number or not, this solves the ordering for those but may have
    impacts on other series, this has run in beta for a week with no issues being reported so I am releasing this. Please report any issues

  Note:
    The mirror added as batoto has been labeled in AMR as "Batoto (fake)". This has been done because this is not the original site, the domain was
    purchased and an aggregator site has been released under the name. This site appears just like any other aggregator so I have no issue adding it 
    to AMR but I wanted to note that it is a different site before anyone blindly trusts it as the old batoto.

Misc

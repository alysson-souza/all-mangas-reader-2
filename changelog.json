This is a test to see if I can do this without rewriting many parts of the extension to support text. This is best used in webtoon mode and I may look into ways to force it for these. For anyone interested try it out and give me feedback on discord as I fine tune this.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n-   I have finally gotten around to working on the website. Currently I just copy/pasted the orignal website but I plan on working on it more later to change it. I adjusted the links in amr for my server\r\n-   I created a patreon and adjusted the links, I put this off for a long time but decided to end up doing it after all. My commitment to mainting this stays the same no matter the result of this as I use this extension extensively myself so keeping it maintained is also for my own use",
